I'm a junior at Princeton University majoring in Computer Science and pursuing minors in
Optimization & Quantitative Decision Sciences as well as Cognitive Science. At Princeton, I'm active in
the Association for Computing Machinery, Princeton University Nonprofit Consulting, and Princeton Consulting Group.
I'm also the current Music Director of Old Nassoul and the Vice President Emeritus of the Asian American Students' Association.

I grew up in Queens, New York and attended High School at the Trinity School, where I explored my many interests:
they ranged from track and field to Latin to Academic Quiz Bowl. I often had opportunities to explore technology specifically, interning at JP Morgan Chase & Co. as part of the Financial Crimes Transaction Monitoring Team and participating in Prep for Prep's Institute for Entrepreneurship.
